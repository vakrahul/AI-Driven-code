# AI-Driven Code Reviewer

An automated assistant for code analysis, error detection, and optimization suggestions, developed during the **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship**.

##  About the Project

The **AI-Driven Code Reviewer** is a web-based application designed to help developers improve Python code quality efficiently.  
It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **static code analysis techniques** to detect errors, enforce best practices, and provide intelligent optimization suggestions.

The application analyzes Python code using:
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** for structural understanding
- **PEP 8 style rules** for readability and maintainability
- **Qwen 2.5 Large Language Model** for AI-powered insights and refactoring advice

This tool aims to simulate an intelligent code reviewer that assists developers during development and learning.
